# The Odin Project: **Restaurant Page**

## Description
**Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Webpack**

This project is meant to demonstrate the use of ES6 Modules and a module bundler called webpack.

This is a simple website where the user can toggle between 3 pages in the navbar. However, under the hood the 3 pages have been broken into their own components that will be compiled through Webpack.
